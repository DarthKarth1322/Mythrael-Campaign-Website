		<h2>A Brief History</h2>
		<p>
			The continent of Mythrael is a distant land across the vast <a href="https://darthkarth1322.github.io/Mythrael-Campaign-Website/Locations/Dread-Sea">Dread Sea.</a> Not much is known about it, but one thing is obvious; the magic there is some of the strongest on the material plane. It was discovered about 6 centuries ago by the infamous Dwarven pirate, <a href="https://darthkarth1322.github.io/Mythrael-Campaign-Website/Bios/Iron-Beard">Captain Iron Beard</a>. He used this land as a cache for his stolen treasures until the end of his pirating days. When he died his crew kept his belongings, which included the maps he had made of Mythrael. Decades later, those maps were discovered by the forces of <a href="https://darthkarth1322.github.io/Mythrael-Campaign-Website/Bios/King-Leonidas">King Leonidas</a> when they finally managed to defeat Iron Beard's crew in <a href="https://darthkarth1322.github.io/Mythrael-Campaign-Website/Lore/Battles/Golden-Pony">The Battle for Golden Pony</a>. Seeing the strategic advantage of taking this land for himself, King Leonidas secretly sent a slew of ships to colonize the continent in his name. He called this initiative <a href="https://darthkarth1322.github.io/Mythrael-Campaign-Website/Lore/Project-Newland">"Project Newland"</a>. Upon arriving in this far off land, the colonizers faced many hardships as they established the first city in this new world; <a href="https://darthkarth1322.github.io/Mythrael-Campaign-Website/Locations/Clonio">Clonio</a>. Nearly a century later, this city has grown to the size of modern day Chicago thanks to the influx of adventurers looking to tame this wild, mystical new continent.
