    <h2>A Brief History</h2>
    <p>The continent of Mythrael is a distant land across a vast sea. Not much is known about it, but one thing is obvious;
      the magic there is some of the strongest on the material plane. It was discovered about 6 centuries ago by the infamous
      Dwarven pirate Iron Beard. He used this land as a cache for his stolen treasures for the rest of his pirating days. 
      Decades after his death, the maps he had made of Mythrael had been discovered by the forces of King Leonidas after defeating
      his crew in battle. Seeing the strategic advantage of taking this land for himself, he secretly sent a slew of ships to 
      colonize the continent in his name. Upon arriving in this far off land, the colonizers established the city of Clonio. 
      Nearly a century later, this city has grown to the size of modern day Chicago thanks to the influx of adventurers looking
      to tame this wild, new land.</p>
